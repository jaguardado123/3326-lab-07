# Lab Assignment 07

In this lab you will practice working with ranges and intervals.

Same as the previous labs, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the src/ directory and name your class accordingly and remember to make it **public**. Next, **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

## Ranges and Intervals

An interval is measured in terms of numbers. An interval includes all the numbers that come between two particular numbers.

This range includes all the real numbers between those two numbers. Real numbers are any kind of number you can think of. 

### Interval Notation

Interval notation is written using square [] or () round brackets to indicate the range between two numbers.

* A square bracket [ ], if we want to include the endpoints 
* A round bracket ( ), if we donâ€™t want to include the endpoints

**Example**


* [6, 20] if the interval includes 6 and 20
* (6, 20) if the interval excludes 6 and 20 
* (6, 20] if the interval excludes 6 but includes 20
* [6, 20) if the interval includes 6 but excludes 20 



## Your program

**Find the Range**

For this assignment you will practice working with the following ranges.

* **Blue:** [-45, 0)
* **Red:** [0, 45)
* **Green:** [-90, -45) and [45, 90]

## Submit your assignment

To submit your lab assignment click on the source control icon (3 circles with 2 lines) on your leftside navbar. Next, click on the '+' symbol next to "Changes" to stage your changes. Lastly, add a commit message (ex: "First commit") and click "Commit" then "Push" or "Sync Changes". And you're done!
